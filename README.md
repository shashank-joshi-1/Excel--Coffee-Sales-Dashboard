 Coffee Sales Dashboard — Excel Data Analytics Project
Problem Statement:
A global coffee company wanted to analyze its multi-country sales data to identify top-performing products, customer trends, and sales performance over time. However, sales insights were scattered across multiple sheets (orders, products, customers), making it difficult for management to make data-driven decisions regarding product mix, geography-based sales, and customer loyalty patterns.

Project Objective:
To design a dynamic, interactive Excel dashboard that consolidates sales, product, and customer data — enabling management to quickly visualize performance insights such as:
Total revenue and profit trends across countries
Top 5 customers and their purchase patterns
Sales breakdown by coffee type, roast type, and package size
Year-over-year growth and profitability analysis
Impact of loyalty programs on repeat purchases

Key Tasks & Analysis Performed:
Data cleaning and transformation using Excel formulas and structured references
Creation of relational models between Orders, Customers, and Products tables
Applied Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers for dynamic filtering (Country, Coffee Type, Roast Type)
Built KPIs and metrics for total sales, quantity sold, and average profit per SKU
Designed an interactive dashboard for executive-level decision-making

 Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Validation, Charts, Conditional Formatting)
Dashboard design and storytelling through visual data representation

Insights Generated:
Arabica and Robusta contributed the highest revenue share across key markets.
Medium roast variants dominated customer preferences in both the US and Ireland.
Loyalty card customers showed a higher repeat purchase rate and higher average order value.

Outcome:
A single consolidated dashboard providing end-to-end visibility into sales performance, enabling data-backed decisions on pricing, promotions, and product strategy.
